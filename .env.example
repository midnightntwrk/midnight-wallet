# Environment Configuration for Midnight Wallet SDK
#
# This file contains environment variables used for configuring the Midnight Wallet SDK
# for local development and testing. Copy this file to .env and fill in the values.
#
# Note: The .env file is excluded from git (see .gitignore) and will not be committed.
# When copying to .env, you may remove this header and other comments if desired.

# NETWORK: Specifies which Midnight network to use for wallet operations.
# Default value for local development.
NETWORK=undeployed

# DEPLOYMENT: Specifies which deployment environment to use.

# APP_INFRA_* variables: Configuration for local infrastructure (Docker Compose)
#
# These environment variables are used when running tests against the local Docker Compose
# setup, which includes the indexer-standalone container.
#
# For detailed information about indexer configuration options, see:
# https://github.com/midnightntwrk/midnight-indexer?tab=readme-ov-file#running
#
# Note: This project uses only the indexer-standalone component from the Midnight Indexer.

# APP_INFRA_SECRET: Hex-encoded 32-byte secret used by the indexer-standalone
# to encrypt stored sensitive data. This is required when running tests against
# the indexer-standalone container.
#
# Generate a secure secret using one of these commands:
#   Linux/macOS: openssl rand -hex 32
#   This will output 64 hex characters (32 bytes).
#
# IMPORTANT: Generate a unique secret for your environment.
