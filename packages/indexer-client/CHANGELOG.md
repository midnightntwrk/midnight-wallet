# @midnightntwrk/wallet-sdk-indexer-client

## 2.0.0-beta.2

### Major Changes

- 5d25685: feat(indexer-client): automate the GraphQL schema sync and bump to indexer v4.3.2 (#305)

  A new `schema:sync` script keeps the committed schema (`indexer.gql`) and its generated types locked to a pinned
  indexer release, replacing the manual copy that used to drift. The pinned schema is bumped to v4.3.2.

  BREAKING CHANGE: the generated types are now produced by graphql-codegen's operation-scoped `client` preset, so the
  package no longer re-exports bare schema types. Names like `Maybe`, `InputMaybe`, `Scalars`, and object types such as
  `Block` and `TransactionResult` are no longer exported — use the operation types (e.g. `TransactionStatusQuery`)
  instead.

### Minor Changes

- b9c1150: Hard-fork support. A wallet runs ledger-v8 (`@midnight-ntwrk/ledger-v8`) below the chain's fork version and
  ledger-v9 (`@midnightntwrk/ledger-v9`) from it, and follows a live chain across the boundary: balances, coins and
  transaction history survive the crossing, and a wallet restored from a V1 snapshot crosses too. Applications no longer
  import a ledger package.

  ### Breaking: configuration and starting
  - `forks.v9` is required in the shielded, dust and unshielded configurations: the protocol version at which the chain
    switches ledgers. There is no default in the wallet packages. `ProtocolVersion.V9NativeForkVersion`, from the
    abstractions package, is the value a 2.x chain reports (2000000); the final mainnet constant is not fixed yet, so
    supply it per environment. The facade presets this value when `forks` is left out — see the facade changeset.
  - `chainVersionProbe` is a new optional setting on all three wallets. By default a wallet asks the indexer, on every
    start, which protocol version the chain's first block was produced under, with a 5-second timeout, and starts on the
    matching side. A failed probe never fails a start: the wallet starts on V1 and crosses on its first synced update. A
    custom probe must answer the same question.
  - Wallets start from seeds. On `ShieldedWallet(...)` and `DustWallet(...)`, `startWithSecretKeys` and
    `startWithSecretKey` are removed; `startWithSeed(seed)` and `startWithKeys({ v8, v9 })` replace them and return a
    `Promise`. The unshielded `startWithPublicKey` also returns a `Promise` now. The single-variant
    `CustomShieldedWallet` and `CustomDustWallet` keep their synchronous starts and cannot cross a fork. The instance
    method `start(secretKeys)` stays and is right for a wallet restored at or past the fork.
  - Dust parameters are optional. `DustWallet(...).startWithSeed(seed, dustParameters?)` and
    `DefaultDustConfiguration.dustParameters` take a plain `DustGenerationRates` object and default to the ledger's
    initial parameters.
  - The facade starts from `WalletSeeds.fromMasterSeed(masterSeed)` or from `FacadeKeysByEpoch`
    (`{ v8: { shielded, dust }, v9: { shielded, dust } }`). Its third `start` argument is now an options object
    (`{ manualSync?: boolean }`), and `doSync` takes the same start material as `start`.
  - The `secretKeys` parameter is gone from every transaction-building method. A stopped wallet drops its key material;
    transacting after `stop()` fails with `MissingStartAuxError`.

  ### Breaking: transactions carry the version that built them
  - Every facade and wallet method that took or returned a ledger transaction now uses `WalletTransaction`, a handle
    that records the protocol version the transaction was built for. A handle from the other side of the fork is refused
    with `ProtocolVersionMismatchError`, which names the version in `authoredFor`. Applications that build their own
    transactions import `@midnightntwrk/wallet-sdk/ledger/v8` or `/ledger/v9` (not re-exported from the root) and seal
    the result with `WalletTransaction.adopt('Unproven', tx, protocolVersion)`. Handles serialize with `toWire` and
    `fromWire`. Authoring against `/ledger/v9` on a chain that has not crossed compiles and fails at run time.
  - `FacadeState.pending` is now an array of `{ transaction, submittedAt, authoredFor, status }`; the pending-set object
    it used to be is gone. `status` is `Submitted`, `Confirmed`, `Rejected` or `Orphaned` (`{ authoredFor, chainNow }`).
    A transaction still pending at the fork is orphaned: it can never be included, so its coins are released and history
    records the rejection with reason `orphaned-by-protocol-upgrade`. `revert` and `revertTransaction` accept an
    optional reason. The unshielded `revertTransaction` ignores a handle from the other side of the fork.
  - Facade recipes (`FinalizedTransactionRecipe`, `UnboundTransactionRecipe`, `UnprovenTransactionRecipe`) gain a
    required `protocolVersion`, and `BlockData` gains a required `protocolVersion`.
  - Proving, validation and block ledger-parameter reads route on the transaction's version. Configure a proving backend
    per ledger version as `provers: { v8, v9 }`; `provingServerUrl` remains for a single server. Both fields of
    `DefaultProvingConfiguration` are optional and a configuration with neither fails with `ProvingConfigurationError`.
    `defaultLedgerParametersCodecs(forkVersion)` is the version-routed codec set.

  ### Breaking: the wallet packages' root API
  - `ShieldedWalletState`, `DustWalletState` and `UnshieldedWalletState` lose their `capabilities` and `services` fields
    and the static `mapState`; `fromVariant` replaces it and the constructor is `(protocolVersion, state, projections)`.
    Their `state` is a union of the V1 and V2 core states. The unshielded `UnshieldedWalletCapabilities` and
    `UnshieldedWalletServices` types are deleted. Shielded `BalancingResult` is renamed `ShieldedBalancingResult`.
  - `DefaultShieldedConfiguration`, `DefaultDustConfiguration` and `DefaultUnshieldedConfiguration` are declared by each
    package rather than aliased to a variant's; the testkit's configuration types follow.
  - The `./v1` subpath of each wallet package, and `shielded/v1`, `dust/v1`, `unshielded/v1` in
    `@midnightntwrk/wallet-sdk`, now export the ledger-v8 wallet. The ledger-v9 wallet moved to `./v2` with `V1`-named
    exports renamed to `V2`. `./v1` is not a plain copy: the dust `./v1` has no projections-based fast sync (it rests on
    ledger-v9 APIs); the unshielded `./v1` has its own `createKeystore` whose secret is a plain `Uint8Array`, no ECDSA,
    and no `SchemeMismatchError`; `Simulator` on `./v1` is the ledger-v8 simulator only. Both subpaths gain a
    `Migration` namespace, and their builders gain `withStartAux`, `withStartAuxDefaults`, `withMigration` and
    `withMigrationDefaults`.
  - Root entry points keep their names and gain the forking wallet types, `ProtocolVersion.V9NativeForkVersion`,
    `DustGenerationRates` with `asV8DustParameters` and `asV9DustParameters`, and snapshot inspection: `Restore`
    (shielded) and `UnshieldedRestore` namespaces, and the dust `peekProtocolVersion` and
    `UnsupportedSnapshotVersionError`.
  - Existing snapshots restore; `restore` and the new `tryRestore` route on the protocol version a snapshot declares,
    and `tryRestore` returns the reason a snapshot cannot be read instead of throwing. Shielded snapshots written
    mid-crossing carry `coinHashesPending`, and pending-transaction entries now record their protocol version.
  - Sync types: the shielded and dust `WalletSyncUpdate` are tagged unions on `_tag`, the unshielded one is
    discriminated on `type` (its indexer-decoded shape is exported as `IndexerSyncUpdate`), and all three gain a
    `VersionSignal` member. Shielded and dust event schemas deliver events as raw hex, decoded by the variant that
    applies them; the unshielded progress frame requires `protocolVersion`. Custom sync capabilities receive the
    protocol-version range they own as a third `applyUpdate` argument and must leave updates at or beyond it unapplied.
    Exported helpers implement the rule; ignoring the argument keeps the old behaviour.

  ### Breaking: runtime, capabilities and abstractions

  For code that composes wallets or test fixtures by hand.

  - Abstractions: `ProtocolState` requires a `variantTag` and `getEquivalence` compares it. `ProtocolVersion.Registry`
    (`makeRegistry`, `makeRegistryFromActivations`, `select`, `selectEntry`) picks the implementation for a protocol
    version; `ProtocolVersion.epochOf` says which side of a fork a version is on. New errors `RegistryError` and
    `InvalidTokenTypeError`.
  - Runtime: `Variant.migrateState` may fail with `WalletRuntimeError`.
    `withVariant(sinceVersion, builder, configuration?)` accepts a per-variant configuration.
    `VariantContext.activationRange` carries the variant's version range and `Runtime.onVariantActivation` fires when a
    migration activates one. New `StartMaterial` module, `RuntimeState`, `variantFor` and `startAtVariant`.
  - Capabilities: new subpaths `./chainVersion` (`timelineStartChainVersion`, `BlockVersionAnswer`,
    `makeIndexerChainVersionProbe`, `ChainVersionUnavailableError`), `./codecs` (`makeCodecs`, `decode`,
    `UnsupportedProtocolVersionError`, `LedgerParametersDecodeError`) and `./signatures` (`Signing`,
    `UnsupportedSignatureKindError`). Pending transactions are versioned: `addPendingTransaction(tx, protocolVersion)`,
    new `orphanBeyond(chainNow)`, `txTraits: VersionedTransactionTrait`, `OrphanedByForkResult`, `allOrphaned`,
    `allRejected`. Proving and validation services are `VersionedProvingService` and `VersionedValidationService`
    (`validateTx(tx, protocolVersion, options)`), with `UnsupportedProvingVersionError` and
    `UnsupportedValidationVersionError`; the facade's injectable services take these shapes.
  - Simulation: one simulator per ledger version, `V8` and `V9`; the v9 names stay exported unqualified, so existing
    imports are unaffected. `ForkSimulator` drives one chain across a boundary and requires a `translator`
    (`LedgerStateTranslator`, `translatorFromAsync`, `unavailableTranslator`). Simulators gain a protocol-version
    timeline: `SimulatorConfig.protocolVersion`, `setProtocolVersion`, `scheduleFork`, `produceEmptyBlock`, and
    `protocolVersion` on blocks.
  - Indexer client: `protocolVersion` is read on `BlockHash`, `DustLedgerEvents`, `DustNullifierTransactions` and the
    unshielded progress frame. New id-only subscriptions `ZswapEventTip` and `DustLedgerEventTip`.
  - HD: `WalletSeeds.fromMasterSeed(masterSeed, { account?, addressIndex?, unshieldedRole? })` derives the three
    per-wallet seeds at `m/44'/2400'/account'/role/index` (roles 0 unshielded, 2 dust, 3 shielded;
    `Roles.EcdsaUnshielded` for an ECDSA unshielded identity), throws `SeedDerivationError`, and is specified with test
    vectors in the wallet specification.
  - Umbrella: new subpath `capabilities/codecs`; the root exports `Token.night`, `parseTokenType`, `Signing` and
    `UnsupportedSignatureKindError`, so token types and signatures need no ledger import.

  ### Behaviour at the fork
  - `FacadeState.protocolVersion`, `activeProtocolVersion` and `protocol` report where the wallets are: `Settled`
    (`{ version }`) or `Crossing` (`{ from, to, behind }`).
  - The shielded wallet carries its local state across as bytes, coins at their positions in the commitment tree. Coin
    commitments and nullifiers need keys a migration lacks, so they are computed on the first synced update after the
    crossing; until then `balances`, `availableCoins` and `pendingCoins` read empty, and a snapshot written in that
    window restores. The dust wallet starts empty and rebuilds from the chain, which wipes and replays dust at the fork.
    Unshielded state is copied field by field; UTxOs booked by transactions still pending at the fork return to the
    available balance. After a migration each wallet restarts its own sync; `stop` prevents a late restart.
  - Wallet state records the protocol version the indexer reports and it only ever increases, so replayed history cannot
    drag a wallet back across the boundary.
  - A wallet with no traffic of its own still notices the fork. The unshielded wallet reads the version off its progress
    frames and adopts it once caught up to the frame's highest transaction id. Shielded and dust re-ask the chain's tip
    on a timer (`DefaultSyncConfiguration.versionWatch.intervalMs`, default 30 s, zero or less disables), and record it
    only once level with the far end of their own event timeline, so a hand-over never outruns unread history.
  - Carried Night UTxOs cross with `registeredForDustGeneration: false`, matching what the indexer reports after the v9
    fork, so re-registering for dust generation on ledger-v9 funds its own fee.
    `claimableFeePayment(dustState, nightUtxos, now)` is exported for callers that want the amount
    `waitForGeneratedDust` waits on.
  - Known limitations: shielded spends pending at the fork stay locked afterwards until the ledger offers a way to clear
    them; the dust projections-based fast sync does not hand over at a fork on its own (only relevant at a future fork)
    and now logs its resume cursors at debug level; a fresh dust wallet on a chain that forked over history replays the
    ledger-v8 dust events before crossing.

  ### Dependencies
  - `@midnightntwrk/ledger-v9` `1.0.0-rc.4`. Its dust spend circuit differs from rc.3, so an rc.4 chain rejects proofs
    from a proof server built for rc.3. Proof-server image tags do not track ledger tags: run `9.0.0-rc.7`, the build
    the rc.4 ledger declares. The `./testing` containers in `@midnightntwrk/wallet-sdk-utilities` default to it.
  - `@midnight-ntwrk/ledger-v8` is now a runtime dependency of the capabilities, wallet, facade, testkit and umbrella
    packages, so browser bundles load two ledger WASM modules.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [b9c1150]
  - @midnightntwrk/wallet-sdk-utilities@1.2.2-beta.0

## 1.3.0-beta.1

### Minor Changes

- e89ab0b: Track transaction lifecycle in transaction history. Submitted transactions are now recorded as pending,
  transition to finalized once confirmed by the indexer, and to rejected if they are reverted — giving a single,
  consistent view of in-flight and settled transactions.

### Patch Changes

- 1eaad77: Pin internal `@midnightntwrk/wallet-sdk-*` dependencies to exact versions instead of caret ranges. A caret
  range on a prerelease base (e.g. `^5.0.0-beta.0`) satisfies canary snapshots published on the same `major.minor.patch`
  (`5.0.0-canary.*`), and since `canary` sorts above `beta`/`alpha`, installing a prerelease pulled canary builds of the
  sibling packages. Exact pins make published releases resolve to a single coherent set regardless of what snapshots
  exist on the registry.
- 057701e: fix: pins internal dependencies

## 1.2.4-beta.0

### Patch Changes

- 44bbcae: Remove unused devDependencies `@graphql-codegen/typescript` and `@graphql-codegen/typescript-operations`.
  They are bundled transitively by `@graphql-codegen/client-preset` (used via `preset: 'client'` in `codegen.ts`), so
  dropping them as direct dependencies has no effect on code generation or the published package.

## 1.2.3

### Patch Changes

- 417d042: Fix a fiber/memory leak in the WebSocket subscription stream. At the indexer's sustained ~1k msg/sec push
  rate, `Stream.async` was forking a top-level fiber per emit (via `Runtime.runPromiseExit`) and accumulating them in
  Effect's `Global.roots`. Switched to `Stream.asyncPush`, which writes straight to an internal queue and ties teardown
  to the surrounding scope via `Effect.acquireRelease`. Also preserves the full GraphQL error array as `cause` on
  `ClientError` and joins all error messages instead of dropping all but the first.

## 1.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 25f58b4: Widen ranges for internal `@midnightntwrk/wallet-sdk-*` dependencies from exact versions to caret ranges so
  consumers can dedupe shared sibling packages into a single installed copy.
- Updated dependencies [6e187fe]
- Updated dependencies [7452e96]

- 7f82432: Introduce a shared transaction history storage layer with support for wallet-specific augmentation.
  Reimplement shielded wallet transaction history and refactor unshielded wallet transaction history to use the new
  shared storage.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- aa7b1f4: chore: update ledger to v8

### Patch Changes

- 9d71d25: feat: expose Terms and Conditions via `WalletFacade.fetchTermsAndConditions`

  Adds a new `FetchTermsAndConditions` GraphQL query to `@midnightntwrk/wallet-sdk-indexer-client` that retrieves the
  current Terms and Conditions (URL and SHA-256 hash) from the network indexer.

  Exposes a new static method `WalletFacade.fetchTermsAndConditions(configuration)` in
  `@midnightntwrk/wallet-sdk-facade` that wallet builders can call before or independently of wallet initialization to
  obtain the T&C URL for display and the hash for content verification. The method accepts any configuration that
  includes `indexerClientConnection.indexerHttpUrl`, so the shared wallet configuration can be passed directly without
  adaptation.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- f52d01d: - Create a pending transactions service in the `@midnightntwrk/wallet-sdk-capabilities` package. The service
  checks TTL and status of transactions against indexer in order to report failures. The service state is also meant to
  be serialized and restored in order to not loose track of pending transactions in case of wallet restarts
  - Integrate the pending transactions service into the `WalletFacade`. It registers transactions as soon as they are
    finalized (it can't happen earlier because unproven transactions contain copies of secret keys for proving
    purposes). Whenever a pending transaction is reported as failed - it is reverted. The pending transactions service
    state is also reported in the facade state for serialization purposes and to enable UI reporting.

### Patch Changes

- 6c359b8: Expose promise-based QueryRunner utility for executing GraphQL queries without Effect boilerplate
- dd004db: Add optional `keepAlive` config param to `SubscriptionClient.ServerConfig` and to `IndexerClientConnection`
  in all wallet packages. The value is forwarded to the underlying `graphql-ws` client and defaults to `15_000` ms when
  not provided.
- Updated dependencies [55380e5]
