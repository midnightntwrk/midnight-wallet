# Midnight DApp Connector API

This API provides a comprehensive interface for the DApp Connector operations, defining the structure of the wallet state it exposes, the methods for interacting with it, and the types and variables used within.

It's implemented by the Midnight Lace extension for Google Chrome and is injected in the global scope (`window.midnight.mnLace`) of DApps running in browser.
